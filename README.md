This project focuses on building a sales forecasting model using PySpark, a powerful tool for large-scale data processing.
 The model is designed to predict sales quantities based on historical data,
       which includes various features such as product descriptions, quantities, unit prices, customer IDs, countries, and invoice dates. 
  The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction using a machine learning pipeline.
Technologies Used: 
  PySpark: For distributed data processing and machine learning.
  Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
  Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  Scikit-learn: For implementing additional machine learning model.
